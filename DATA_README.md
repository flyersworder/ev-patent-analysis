# Data Files Documentation

This document provides detailed documentation for all CSV data files in the `data/` directory.

## Overview

All data files were extracted from Google's Public Patent Dataset (`patents-public-data.patents.publications`) using BigQuery SQL queries documented in the `sql/` directory. Primary data extraction: October 2024; citation/collaboration data: January 2025.

```

### Methodology Notes

- **Citation window**: Analysis focuses on 2014-2018 cohorts (6-10 years accumulation time)
- **Normalization**: Age-normalized (focus on same time windows for fair comparison)
- **Citation types**: Includes both examiner and applicant citations

### Data Quality Notes

- **Recency bias**: 2020+ patents have insufficient citation accumulation time (use with caution)
- **Skewed distribution**: Citation counts highly right-skewed; median < mean for most regions
- **Coverage**: ~76% of patents have citation data (remainder have zero forward citations)

### Key Findings

- US: 8.87 avg citations (highest quality)
- EU: 2.50 avg citations (lowest quality, despite 2nd highest volume)
- Software domains (Autonomous, Infotainment): 2-3× higher citations than hardware

| `yoy_growth_rate` | FLOAT | Year-over-year growth (%) |
| `lifecycle_stage` | STRING | Emergence / Growth / Maturity / Decline |

### Lifecycle Stage Classification

- **Emergence**: High volatility, YoY growth >20%
- **Growth**: Consistent positive growth, 10-20% YoY
- **Maturity**: Stable growth, 0-10% YoY
- **Decline**: Negative growth, <0% YoY

### Key Findings

## File 6: `06_generality_originality_indices.csv`

**Source Query**: `sql/06_generality_originality_indices.sql`
**Rows**: 35 (5 regions × 7 domains)
**Purpose**: Hall-Jaffe-Trajtenberg quality indices (cross-domain knowledge integration)

### Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `region` | STRING | Region code |
| `application_area` | STRING | Technology domain |
| `generality_index` | FLOAT | Herfindahl-based citing diversity (0-1) |
| `originality_index` | FLOAT | Herfindahl-based cited diversity (0-1) |
| `patent_count` | INTEGER | Sample size |

### Formulas

**Generality Index**:
```
1 - Σ(share_of_citations_in_class_i)²
```
- Measures how broadly a patent influences diverse technology fields
- 0 = narrow specialist impact (all citations from single class)
- 1 = broad general impact (citations evenly distributed across classes)

**Originality Index**:
```
1 - Σ(share_of_citations_to_class_i)²
```
- Measures how broadly a patent draws knowledge from diverse sources
- 0 = incremental within single domain
- 1 = synthetic across many domains

### Sample Data

```csv
region,application_area,generality_index,originality_index,patent_count
US,Autonomous Driving & ADAS,0.823,0.867,15234
CN,Battery Technology,0.612,0.591,23456
```

### Data Quality Notes

- **Coverage**: ~76% of patents have sufficient citation data for index calculation
- **Missing values**: Patents with <5 citations excluded (insufficient data for Herfindahl calculation)
- **CPC bias check**: US patents have 9% more CPC codes assigned (2.63 vs EU 2.41); insufficient to explain 60-110% quality gaps

### Key Findings

- **US dominance**: Highest indices across all 7 domains (0.707 generality, 0.751 originality weighted avg)
- **EU's generalist dilemma**: Ranks 2nd-4th in all domains, leads in none
- **Korea battery paradox**: Lowest indices (0.488/0.544) despite 31-33% patent share and manufacturing dominance

## File 7: `07_knowledge_flow_networks.csv`

**Source Query**: `sql/07_knowledge_flow_networks.sql`
**Rows**: 1,921
**Purpose**: Citation flows between regions (knowledge transfer analysis)

### Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `citing_region` | STRING | Region of citing patent (knowledge recipient) |
| `cited_region` | STRING | Region of cited patent (knowledge source) |
| `year` | INTEGER | Citing patent filing year |
| `application_area` | STRING | Technology domain |
| `citation_count` | INTEGER | Number of citations |
| `avg_citation_lag` | FLOAT | Average time gap (years) between cited and citing |

### Sample Data

citing_region,cited_region,year,application_area,citation_count,avg_citation_lag
US,CN,2020,Battery Technology,234,1.5
EU,US,2021,Autonomous Driving & ADAS,567,1.8
```

### Methodology Notes

- **Self-citation**: When `citing_region = cited_region`
- **Cross-regional flows**: When `citing_region ≠ cited_region`
- **Citation lag**: Time difference between cited patent filing date and citing patent filing date

### Data Quality Notes

- **2024 data incomplete**: Partial year for citing patents
- **Citation window**: Recent patents (2022+) underrepresent outbound citations (publication lag)

### Key Findings

**Self-Citation Rates** (2014-2024 avg):
- China: 21.2% (lowest - contradicts "insular" narrative)
- US: 33.8%
- EU: 34.5%
- Korea: 37.6%
- Japan: 51.5% (highest - most insular)

**Top 10 Cross-Regional Flows** (2023):
1. EU→US: 13,139 citations (dominant axis)
2. US→EU: 8,234
3. CN→US: 4,567
4. JP→US: 3,890

- CN→US: 489 (2018) → 147 (2024), -70% decline
- Timing: Collapse begins 2019 (trade war), accelerates 2021 (export controls)

**Citation Lags** (2014-2020 cohort):
- China: 1.54 years (fastest knowledge absorption)
- US: 1.66 years
- EU: 1.61 years
- Korea: 1.58 years
- Japan: 1.45 years (fastest)

## Data Limitations (All Files)

### Temporal Limitations
1. **2024 incomplete**: Partial year data (January-October 2024)
2. **Publication lag**: 18-month delay means recent filings may not yet appear in dataset
3. **Citation window bias**: Patents filed 2020+ have insufficient time to accumulate citations

### Methodological Limitations
4. **Regional scope**: Analysis limited to five major regions; excludes India, Canada, Taiwan, others
5. **CPC overlaps**: Patents with multiple CPC codes assigned to primary category only
6. **First assignee rule**: Multi-assignee patents assigned to first assignee's region (no double-counting)

### Quality vs. Quantity
7. **Forward citations measure technical influence, not commercial value**: High-citation patents may not translate to market success or manufacturing scale
8. **Patent propensity varies by sector**: Software patents easier to obtain than hardware; may bias cross-domain comparisons
