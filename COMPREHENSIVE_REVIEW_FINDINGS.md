## REVIEW 1: NUMBERS CONSISTENCY & EVIDENCE-BASED CLAIMS

### ‚úÖ VERIFIED CLAIMS

1. **EU Share Decline** (Abstract, Introduction)
   - CLAIM: 26.3% (2014) ‚Üí 17.3% (2024), decline of 9 percentage points
   - DATA: Exactly verified ‚úì
   - SOURCE: data/01_global_context_5regions.csv

2. **Collaboration Rate Range** (Abstract, Introduction)
   - CLAIM: 0.65-1.28% of patents
   - DATA: Min 0.65%, Max 1.28% ‚úì
   - SOURCE: data/02_collaborative_patents.csv

3. **China Self-Citation Rate** (Abstract, Introduction, Section 5.2)
   - CLAIM: 21.2% (lowest among regions)
   - DATA: Needs verification against Section 5.2 data
   - NOTE: Multiple mentions - verify consistency

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES REQUIRING CLARIFICATION

1. **Citation Quality Numbers - Period Ambiguity** üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
   - CLAIM (used throughout paper): EU 2.50, US 8.87 citations
   - DATA VERIFICATION:
     - 2014-2018 cohort: EU=2.50, US=8.87 ‚úì EXACT MATCH
     - 2014-2020 cohort: EU=2.08, US=7.16
     - All years (2014-2024): EU=1.39, US=4.76

   **FINDING**: The claim is CORRECT but refers specifically to 2014-2018 cohort

   **ACTION NEEDED**:
   - Verify paper explicitly states "2014-2018 cohort" when citing 2.50/8.87
   - Check for consistency - are we mixing cohorts anywhere?
   - Section 4 should clarify which period is primary

   **LOCATIONS TO CHECK**:
   - Abstract (line 19)
   - Introduction (line 57)
   - Introduction regional descriptions (lines 67, 71)
   - Section 5.3 Table 7 (line 2474)
   - Section 6 knowledge flows (line 2343)
   - Conclusion (line 2681)

2. **US-China Knowledge Flow Collapse** (Abstract)
   - CLAIM: 64-70% decline
   - STATUS: Needs verification against data/07_knowledge_flow_networks.csv
   - Check both directions: US‚ÜíCN and CN‚ÜíUS

### üìã REMAINING VERIFICATIONS NEEDED

**Section 3 (Five-Region Race)**:
- [ ] Regional shares by year (Figure 1)
- [ ] Domain-specific shares (Figure 2)
- [ ] RCA values (autonomous 1.22, infotainment 1.37)
- [ ] EU thermal: 44%, safety: 47%
- [ ] Korea batteries: 31%

**Section 4 (Patent Quality)**:
- [ ] Citation averages by domain
- [ ] EU ranks last in 6 of 7 domains claim
- [ ] Software vs hardware 2-3√ó citation difference

**Section 5 (Collaboration & Knowledge Flows)**:
- [ ] Top collaboration pairs (EU-JP 5,410, EU-US 4,966, etc.)
- [ ] US-China collapse trajectory (273‚Üí562‚Üí135)
- [ ] Self-citation rates for all regions
- [ ] Knowledge flow magnitudes (EU-US 13,139 citations)

**Section 5.3 (Testing Propositions)**:
- [ ] Table 7 all numerical claims
- [ ] Verify proposition support levels

**Section 6 (China Case Study)**:
- [ ] Battery share evolution (8.7%‚Üí47.0%)
- [ ] Infotainment share evolution
- [ ] Citation quality comparisons
- [ ] Development cycle times (24 months claim)

**Section 7 (EU Strategic Imperatives)**:
- [ ] Scenario projections for 2030
- [ ] Current baseline data accuracy

## SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACTIONS

### HIGH PRIORITY (Fix before publication)
1. üî¥ Clarify citation period (2014-2018 cohort) consistently throughout paper
2. üî¥ Verify all Section 5.3 Table 7 numbers
3. üî¥ Verify China case study numbers (battery, infotainment shares)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Verify for accuracy)
1. üü° Check US-China collapse percentages
2. üü° Verify collaboration pair magnitudes
3. üü° Verify RCA values in introduction

### LOW PRIORITY (Nice to have)
1. ‚ö™ Cross-check all scenario projections
2. ‚ö™ Verify domain-specific citation differences

## UPDATE: High-Priority Fixes Completed

### ‚úÖ FIXED: Citation Period Clarity
- **Abstract (line 19)**: Added "(2014-2018 cohort)" after "European patents"
- **Introduction (line 57)**: Added "(2014-2018 cohort)" after "European patents"
- **Result**: Now explicitly states which cohort the 2.50/8.87 numbers refer to

### ‚ö†Ô∏è INVESTIGATION NEEDED: Table 7 Numbers

**Issue**: Some Table 7 numbers don't match direct data calculations:

1. **EU thermal**: 
   - Table claims: "44% (2014) ‚Üí 44% (2023)"
   - Data shows: 41% (2014) ‚Üí 33% (2023)
   - **Note**: The "44%" appears throughout paper referring to EU thermal volume share (possibly average or specific subset)

2. **Korea batteries**:
   - Table claims: "27% ‚Üí 31%"
   - Data shows: 30% (2014) ‚Üí 33% (2023)
   - **Close but not exact**

3. **US software (autonomous)**:
   - Table claims: "53-60% stable"
   - Data shows: 31-35% (2014-2024)
   - **Significant discrepancy**

**ACTION**: Need to trace back to Section 3 figures/tables to understand what these percentages actually refer to. They may be:
- Weighted averages
- Specific subsets (e.g., excluding certain years)
- Referring to different metrics than simple patent share

**RECOMMENDATION**: Verify against actual Section 3 data visualizations and tables, not just raw CSV.
