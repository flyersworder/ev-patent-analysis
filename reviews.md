# 1) Short, grounded summary (2–3 lines)

The chapter analyzes 385,000+ EV-related patent families across five regions (US, China, EU, Korea, Japan) and seven EV technology domains for 2014–2024, and finds that Europe, despite high patent volume, has substantially lower patent impact (EU ≈ 2.50 forward citations vs US ≈ 8.87) and declining share in six of seven domains — the “generalist dilemma.” The analysis relies on Google’s Public Patent Dataset (BigQuery) and Hall-Jaffe-Trajtenberg metrics (generality/originality) plus citation-flow and co-patenting indicators.

# 2) Overall assessment & recommendation

**Assessment:** The chapter addresses a highly relevant policy/science question with an impressive dataset and yields compelling high-level patterns (EU volume/low impact paradox; Korea battery focus; China’s consumer-electronics model; collapse of US–China flows). However, in its current state the chapter reads more like a policy white paper than a journal article: key methodological choices and reproducibility details are not sufficiently explicit in the main text, many inferential claims lack formal statistical tests or robustness checks, and the theoretical framing (RBV / NIS / Disruption) is not tightly operationalized into testable propositions.

**Recommendation:** **Major revision** — revise with emphasis on (a) methodological transparency and reproducibility, (b) statistical/robustness support for major claims, (c) clearer linkage between theory and observable measures, and (d) tighter, shorter main text with extended materials in appendices.

# 3) Major revision points (priority order — address these first)

### A. Make the analysis reproducible and transparent (must)

* **Data provenance & exact queries:** The chapter states use of Google Public Patent Dataset and BigQuery (Appendix A), but you must include either (i) the exact SQL query used (or link to a public repository with the query), or (ii) a DOI/Zenodo/GitHub archive with the cleaned dataset and scripts. Right now the Appendix says queries are available on request; for peer review that is insufficient. Add the SQL (or full pseudo-code) to an online appendix and cite it.  
* **CPC mapping & domain assignment:** Appendix A lists CPC ranges (good), but the manuscript must include the full CPC list or mapping table (all codes used per domain) as an appendix file or repository file so others can reproduce domain assignment. The current appendix provides example codes but readers should be able to re-run the extraction exactly. 

### B. Strengthen empirical inference and robustness (must)

* **Citation normalization:** Forward citations accumulate with age and vary by field. Describe precisely how you normalized for age and field (you indicate focus on 2014–2018 cohorts, which helps, but still show the normalization method or show comparative robustness using percentile or field-year normalization). Present confidence intervals and p-values (or non-parametric equivalents) for main differences. 
* **Statistical testing:** Replace or complement descriptive claims (“EU ranks last…”) with statistical tests and effect sizes. For example: Kruskal–Wallis or Mann–Whitney comparisons of citation distributions; regression models predicting normalized citations with controls for domain, year, assignee type, and collaboration. Present results in the main text (key coefficients) and put extended models in appendix.
* **Robustness checks:** Report results under alternate choices: fractional vs whole counting, restricting to triadic families, alternative citation windows (2/3/5 years), excluding utility models/continuations. Include at least 2–3 robustness tables.

### C. Tighten causal/interpretive language (must)

* Reword causal claims (e.g., “Europe’s decline *reflects* institutional fragmentation”) to be more cautious unless supported by causal tests. Use language such as “consistent with”, “plausibly explained by”, and where possible provide evidence (e.g., regression showing EU fragmentation proxy predicts lower normalized citations).

### D. Operationalize theory (important)

* Convert RBV / NIS / Disruption discussion into **2–4 explicit propositions** that map onto measures (e.g., “Regions with higher university-industry linkages will have higher generality/originality indices”). This guides the reader and clarifies how each finding supports or refutes theoretical expectations. 

---

# 4) Section-by-section comments (actionable)

### Abstract & Introduction

* **Abstract length & content:** Shorten to ~200 words, include (a) research question, (b) dataset & methods in one sentence (e.g., “Google Public Patent Dataset; 385k patents; CPC domain mapping; forward citations + HJT indices”), (c) 2–3 crisp results with magnitudes (you already have figures — cite them), and (d) contribution. 
* **Intro:** Add a paragraph with explicit research questions/hypotheses and a short roadmap. You already have four RQs (good) — make them bold and add two short propositions derived from theory. 

### Theory / Literature review

* **Reorganize into a compact conceptual model.** The existing theoretical coverage is solid but diffuse. Add a **single figure** that maps: institutional structure (NIS) → capability endowments (RBV) → strategic choices (business model) → expected patent metrics (volume, citations, generality). This will make interpretation in the results clearer. 

### Data & Methods (Appendix A is good — but expand)

* **Include exact SQL and CPC mapping** (or a link to GitHub/Zenodo with scripts). The appendix says queries available on request — instead publish them. The CPC mapping shown in the py file is good but must be complete (all codes). See Appendix A snippets; move full mapping into a reproducible appendix file. 
* **Counting rules:** You state patents assigned to the first assignee’s country (no double counting). That is a defensible choice, but you must (a) show results under fractional counting as robustness, or (b) justify more strongly why first assignee is preferable for these questions. Also comment on family construction (INPADOC vs simple publication groups). 
* **Citations & time window:** Explain why you use 2014–2018 for citation analysis and provide normalized citation measures where possible. Provide a short table of sample sizes per region×domain for both the full 2014–2024 sample and the 2014–2018 citation cohort.

### Results — Regional shares & domain breakdown

* **Figures/tables:** The high-level patterns (e.g., EU share decline, Korea battery share) are convincing, but please:

  * Add a small table with counts and shares by region×domain for a baseline year (e.g., 2014 and 2023) and number of patents per cell.
  * Provide RCA (revealed comparative advantage) measures for domain specialization.
* **Interpretation:** When you attribute Korea’s battery lead to chaebol policy, treat as a plausible explanation — and if possible include evidence (e.g., correlation of battery patent share with government funding or firm-level counts).

### Results — Collaboration & knowledge flows

* **Clarify collaboration definition and scope.** You currently limit cross-region collaboration to the five regions and count first bilateral pair for tri-region patents; make this explicit in methods (it’s in the Appendix but add a brief reminder in the main text). 
* **US–China collapse:** This is a major and interesting finding. Strengthen by (a) showing timeline plot with annotations of major policy events (tariffs, entity lists), and (b) testing whether the decline is robust to alternative citation definitions (examiner vs applicant citations) and to removing patents with US government assignees. 

### Results — Citation quality, generality & originality

* **Present distributions.** In addition to averages (e.g., EU 2.50 vs US 8.87), show distribution plots (boxplots, violin plots) to reveal skewness and outliers. Citations are heavy-tailed — means can be misleading.
* **Provide sample sizes & CIs.** For each region/domain, report N, mean, median, IQR, and a normalized citation percentile (e.g., top-10% share).
* **Explain generality/originality computation** briefly in main text (full formula is in appendix — good). You already use Herfindahl formulas in Appendix; reference them and show an example patent to illustrate interpretation. 

### Case study (China) & scenarios

* **Case material:** The China case adds valuable qualitative texture. But make explicit where patent evidence ends and interpretive/market evidence (e.g., production shares, firm financials) begins. Cite your market data sources explicitly in text when you discuss production shares and corporate finances.
* **Scenarios:** Keep them, but label them as interpretive scenarios (A/B/C) and show which empirical facts would support or falsify each scenario (i.e., early-warning indicators for policymakers).

### Discussion & policy recommendations

* **More concrete policy instruments.** You recommend “anchor in defensible domains” and “forge EU-Korea alliances.” Make these operational: which EU programs (Horizon Europe, IPCEI, European Battery Alliance), what scale of funding, what performance metrics should be used, and which governance changes are required to overcome fragmentation? Link recommendations to evidence (e.g., how much concentration Korea achieved and via what mechanisms). 

### Conclusion

* Reiterate contributions, limitations, and very specific future work (e.g., firm-level longitudinal regressions, case studies of 3 firms, experimental procurement policies).

# 5) Minor / copy-editing points

* **EU vs Europe:** define scope (EU-27 or broader Europe?) and use one term consistently. You use “EU” and “Europe” interchangeably; define clearly in Data section. 
* **Acronyms:** spell out CPC, BEV, ADAS at first use in the main text (they appear in Appendix but also in introduction).
* **Figure/table placement:** ensure each figure/table is introduced in text before it appears and that captions are self-contained.
* **Length:** main text is still long. Move long tables, the full CPC list, full SQL, and extended robustness tables to online appendices and keep main text tight (~7–9k words).

---

# 6) Suggested prioritized revision checklist (do these in order)

1. **Publish reproducible materials:** upload SQL, CPC list, cleaning scripts, and at least the aggregated region×domain counts to GitHub/Zenodo and include link in Appendix A. (High priority.) 
2. **Add statistical tests & models:** provide at least one multivariate regression predicting normalized citations (controls: domain, year, assignee type, collaboration flag) and a table of results. (High priority.)
3. **Add robustness checks:** fractional counting, triadic families, alternative citation windows; put extended tables in appendix. (High priority.)
4. **Convert theory into 2–4 propositions and add a conceptual figure** mapping theory → metrics. (Medium priority.) 
5. **Clarify collaboration & knowledge-flow definitions** in main text and add a timeline figure for US–China collapse with policy annotations. (Medium priority.) 
6. **Tighten text & move long lists/tables to appendices.** (Medium priority.)
7. **Operationalize policy recommendations** (exact instruments, metrics, governance changes). (Medium/low priority but important for TFSC readership.) 

---

# 7) A few example wording edits you can make immediately

* Replace “Europe’s decline **reflects** institutional fragmentation” with “Europe’s decline is **consistent with** institutional fragmentation as suggested by (a) decay across multiple domains and (b) lack of concentrated domain leadership; formal testing of this mechanism is required.” 
* Where you present mean citation comparisons, add medians and a sentence about skewness: “Citation counts are heavily skewed; therefore we report median, IQR, and normalized percentiles alongside means.”

# 8) Closing — willingness to re-review

This is a strong, policy-relevant study with excellent potential for TFSC once the methodological and inferential gaps are closed. If you’d like, I can:

* (A) produce a **short (editable) revision plan** you can paste into your cover letter summarizing what changed (useful on resubmission), or
* (B) re-review the revised draft after you implement the checklist (I recommend this — I’ll focus on reproducibility, statistical tables, and whether the revised manuscript provides the evidence needed for your strongest claims).
